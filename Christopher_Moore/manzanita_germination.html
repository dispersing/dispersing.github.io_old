                <p class="paragraph_style">I own land in the foothills of San Diego County with an extensive stand of manzanita glauca. I have had no success in my attempts to germinate their seeds. Has anyone had success germinating manzanita seeds? With this year's seeds I am going to try placing the seeds in a refrigerator for three months.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Re: Germinating Manzanita glauca(Big Berry Manzanita)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Arctostapylos seed is extremely difficult to germinate. One approach involves soaking the seeds in acid followed by cold stratification. For that reason cuttings are the preferred propagation method. See *Growing California Native Plants* by Marjorie Schmidt University of California Press for details on growing Manzanitas from cuttings.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">Many manzanitas need fire in order for their seeds to germinate!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">A few years ago, one of my colleagues at Yerba Buena Nursery grew a lovely stand of Arctostaphylos canescens by burning the seed flat.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">You take a wooden seed flat plastic would melt, cover sides with aluminum foil, fill with seed medium, plant the seeds I think she left them on top of the medium, water them in, then cover top with 3 inches of flammable material.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I can't recall what she used - might well have been dried pine needles. Then you set the flat on fire and let it burn down. You will be left with a bunch of ashes covering the seeds.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Leave the ashes there, water the flat at regular intervals just like any othe seed flat. This worked very well with A. canescens, and should work with other fire-dependent species. The resulting plants grew quickly for a manzanita, and looked better than cutting-grown plants.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Re: Germinating Manzanita glauca(Big Berry Manzanita)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Fire. most manzanita species are fire addapted. Try mixing seed and leaf material in a crumpled bag and burning them or as the other note suggests, by covering them with flammable material and burning that.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Re: Germinating Manzanita glauca(Big Berry Manzanita)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I was on a hike on the Nipomo Mesa a couple of years ago and the hike was lead by a very reliable source. I asked him how to germ Arcto seeds-- scarification; by means of a file. I tried it and it works- with a small file; file a small slit in one side of the berry and throw her in some planting mix- I think I use Uncle Malcolms--and it worked.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">Chemical for scarification of seeds<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I am doing a considerable seed project this winter again. I said I wouldn't after transplanting over 50 seedlings last year but when the seeds start to present, it is hard to resist. I plan to scarify what I need and all get planted in trays in the yard for over winter stratification. It worked last year very well for the maples. This year if I can soften some seed coats I hope for better success with a few hollies and a couple of others. So what do you guys use? I have &quot;Secrets of Plant Propagation&quot; and on so many of them it says soak in sulfuric acid. 1) where would I get that? and 2) what do you soak them in? Isn't the acid going to eat anything besides a pyrex beaker? If there is another solution that works please let me know. Last year I tried a few hollies, Redbud, Barberry and Burning Bush with virtually zero results. This year a have American and Deciduous Holly, Black and Honey Locust (I know they're diff), Redbud, and Hawthorn and have gone to a lot of work to clean them. I just want to insure some germination. I realize several of these are hard species to grow from seed but germination of near zero tells me I did something wrong.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Also appreciate a source for Ethyl alcohol. Saw it sited for Bald Cypress from someone here. Didn't get any of them to pop up last year either. I can get Everclear if I have to but avoid liquor stores these days. You can't substitute denatured alcohol as it has had a poison added? I assume this makes it only good for cleaning/thinning and not organic uses?<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">Re: Chemical for scarification of seeds<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Easy method for scarification - use a vice grip to hold the seed and rub it on a file or a piece of hard grit sandpaper. I've used this for manzanita seed, but supposedly fire works for manzanita seed,as well, as the seed is genus is fire adapted. Either way, sulfuric acid seems like a real pain in the neck. The &quot;danger&quot; part of it is not the hassle to me, it's knowing how to handle and mix the stuff and knowing how long is long enough of a soak - it seems like it would take a lot of skill and experience to tell when the acid bath has sufficiently eaten away enough of the seed coat.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">By the way, you are aware that Bald Cypress does NOT need scarification treatment at all, right? If you're having trouble with it either the seed dried out and died or it isn't good seed. Cut it open with a knife ( the &quot;cut test&quot; ) to find out - if it's empty of contains a shrivelled embryo, as opposed to a plump, full, white one, it's no good.<br /></p>

The very low germination is also quite similar to that reported for other species in the genus and suggests that either our crude estimate of viability was way off or there are other factors that are necessary to trigger germination of the entire seed bank.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">“Germination and seed testing.  In natural stands, new seedlings (figure 3) of most species of manzanita grow only after fire, and the seeds of these species are considered to be refractory, that is, germinating only in response to fire-related environmental cues (Keeley 1991, 1995). But unlike the refractory seeds of most chaparral shrubs, manzanita seeds apparently do not become germinable through heat shock (Kauffman and Martin 1991; Keeley 1987a). There is evidence that charate leached from incompletely burned wood can trigger germination in manzanita seeds, but the maximum percentages attained using recently collected seeds were not high (13% for Eastwood manzanita and 19% for greenleaf manzanita (Keeley 1987a, 1991). It is probable that, under field conditions, the seeds change in some way following dispersal (perhaps through dry after-ripening at the embryo level) that renders them more responsive to the charate stimulus. Parker and Kelly (1989) report that hoary manzanita seeds retrieved from the soil seedbank germinated readily in response to charate, whereas hand-harvested seeds less than 1 year old did not. In spite of the massive endocarp, manzanita nutlets are permeable to water, and the enclosed seeds are capable of imbibition without any pretreatment, at least in greenleaf manzanita (Meyer 1997). This explains how charate rather than heat shock could trigger germination. Presumably the charate stimulus enters the seed through the periole.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Even though manzanitas form persistent seedbanks, there is evidence that these seedbanks turn over fairly quickly, as there was no net gain in size of the seedbank in the absence of fire over 10 years for 2 chaparral species (bigberry and Eastwood manzanitas), even in the face of massive inputs (Keeley 1987b). Most of the seed loss appears to be due to rodent predation rather than germination or loss of viability (Keeley and Hays 1976). This suggests that the seeds available for seedling recruitment after fire probably belong mostly to recently produced cohorts.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Even though manzanita nutlets are water-permeable, most reports on germination describe the seeds as hard-seeded, and the traditional pretreatment is sulfuric acid scarification for 3 to 15 hours (Belcher 1985; Berg 1974; Carlson and Sharp 1975; Emery 1988). Because the periole is much weaker than the endocarp wall, acid can enter there and damage the embryo long before the endocarp wall is stripped away, so care must be taken to remove the seeds before this damage occurs (Belcher 1985; Berg 1974). Coalesced nutlets generally require more time in acid than solitary nutlets, perhaps because the perioles, which are on the inner face of each nutlet, are better-protected when the nutlets are coalesced. Chaparral species such as bigberry and Eastwood manzanitas may be rendered immediately germinable by acid scarification, although reported percentages are low—3 to 8% (Berg 1974). Populations of greenleaf manzanita required both acid scarification (2 to 4 hours) and subsequent chilling for 60 days (Berg 1974) and 90 days (Carlson and Sharp 1975). Final germination percentages were 20 to 50%. Bearberry has been reported to respond to warm plus cold stratification following a 3- to 6-hour acid treatment—60 to 120 days at 25 °C, followed by 60 to 90 days at 5 °C (Berg 1974). Final germination percentages ranged from 30 to 60%. Belcher (1985) reported that warm plus cold stratification of bearberry resulted in 40 to 60% germination without acid scarification, but that acid scarification for 3 hours could be substituted for warm stratification. In bearberry, even excised embryos were dormant prior to chilling (Giersbach 1937).<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Emery (1988) reported that a fire treatment (burning 3 to 4 inches of pine straw or excelsior over the planted seeds) in fall resulted in some emergence the following spring for many species of manzanitas, but the mechanism of dormancy loss under these conditions was not further explored. Charate could have been the stimulus responsible for this effect. It would be worth experimenting with charate as a germination stimulant in a nursery propagation setting.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Formal seed quality evaluation in manzanita is rendered difficult by the lack of reliable germination tests and by the thick endocarp. Tetrazolium staining requires excision of the seed from the endocarp by twisting it open along the suture or by cutting the nutlet off-center longitudinally, procedures difficult to carry out without damage (Belcher 1985). A seed unit may contain multiple seeds, only 1 of which has to be viable for the seed unit to be considered viable. For seedlots that have not been incorrectly handled (for example, stored at high moisture content) or stored for long periods, a cut test to determine fill is probably the best way to get a quick idea of total viability.”<br /></p>
