title: QPot paper posted on The R Journal's website
---
<p>Last week our paper on the quasi-potential R package was published on The R Journal's website under <i>Accepted Articles</i>: <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/">link</a>.  This has been a very fruitful collaborative project and I'm very happy to have it 'live.'  Also, note that the authorship listed on the site is not what we have for the paper, but we notified the editor.</p>
