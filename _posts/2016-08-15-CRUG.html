title: Cleveland R Users Group (CRUG) presentation
---
<p>This Wednesday I'm giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/">Cleveland R Users Group (CRUG)</a>.  The foci of the talk will be on (i) implementing ordinary differential, (ii) modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and (iii) using <a href="">our R package, QPot</a>, to calculate quasi-potentials for two-dimensional systems of SDEs.  I am following last month's talk given by R superstar <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>.  It's going to be math-lite and image-heavy.  I also used the program <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/home/">RStudio</a> for the first time because they have a nifty way to create presentations using R markdown as one of the ways that they create dynamic documents in R.  The slides I created are written as .html files, so you can view them in your browser and they can be found by following this link: <a href="https://github.com/dispersing/CRUG_QPotPresentation/blob/master/QPot.md"><i>link to slides</i></a>.</p>
