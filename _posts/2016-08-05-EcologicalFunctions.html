title: A cheat sheet of ecological functions
---
<p>From time to time I find myself referencing <a href="http://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/">Ben Bolker</a>'s book, <a href="https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/"><i>Ecological Models and Data in R</i></a> to quickly look at the references of ecological functions.  They are broken into four groups: (1) piecewise, (2) rational, (3) exponential, and (4) power-law functions.  I've created a modified reference that has them all on a single page---a cheat sheet---that I thought I'd share.  Of course, folks should buy and read the book---it's excellent.</p>
