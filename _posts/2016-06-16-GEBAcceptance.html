---
<p>Steve Vander Wall (University of Nevada, Reno) and I had a paper accepted in <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>.  This is a paper that examines how the occurence plants that are dispersed animals (engaged in seed-dispersal mutualisms) and their distribution across temperate North America.  Our main finding was that the plants engaged in these mutualisms have very different distributions in space and across environmental gradients than those plants that are dispersed abiotically.</p>
<p>I will a post preprint when it's available.</p>
