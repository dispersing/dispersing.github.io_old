title: Paper accepted in <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>
---
<p>Steve Vander Wall and I had our paper accepted in <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>.  This is a paper that examines how the occurence plants that are dispersed by all types of animals across temperate North America.  Our main finding was that the plants that are dispersed by animals have very different distributions in space and across environmental gradients than those plants that are dispersed abiotically.</p>
<p>I will post preprint when it's available.</p>
