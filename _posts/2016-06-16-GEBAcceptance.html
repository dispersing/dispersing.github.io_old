title: Paper accepted in Global Ecology and Biogeography
---
<p>Steve Vander Wall (University of Nevada, Reno) and I had a paper accepted in <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>, `Interaction diversity of North American seed-dispersal mutualisms'.  This is a paper that examines the distribution of plants that are dispersed animals (engaged in seed-dispersal mutualisms) across temperate North America.  Our main finding was that the plants engaged in these mutualisms have very different distributions in space and across environmental gradients than those plants that are dispersed abiotically.</p>
<p>I will a post preprint when it's available.</p>
