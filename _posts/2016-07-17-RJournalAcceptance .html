title: Paper accepted in The R Journal
---
<p>Colleagues and I have had our paper accepted in The R Journal.  A collaborative project, we were composed of a mathematician from University of Maryland, Baltimore (<a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc">Maria Cameron</a>), and two theoretical ecologists (<a href="http://www.bennolting.org">Ben Nolting</a>, <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/CWRU/Home.html">Karen Abbott</a>) and two ecologists straddling the theory-empirical boundary (<a href="http://www.stieha.com/">Chris Stieha</a> and me) from Case Western Reserve University.  Our paper built upon Ben and Karen's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1047.1/abstract">recent paper on using the quasi-potential</a> to assess stability in two-dimensional stochastic systems by creating a package in R that would make it accessible to ecologists (Maria Cameron wrote the C code).  This paper is essentially a methods paper on how to use the package, with several examples to better familiarize users with how the quasi-potential actually works.</p>
