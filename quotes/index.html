	“Scientists are perennially aware that it is best not to trust theory until it is confirmed by evidence. It is equally true . . . that it is best not to put too much faith in facts until they have been confirmed by theory.”
	<br>Robert MacArthur, Geographical Ecology, 1972
	<br><br>
	“As the variance goes to infinity, the information per observation about the location of the average value, 1/sigma^2, goes to zero.  It may seem strange that an observation could provide no information about the mean value.”
	<br>Steve Frank, The Common patterns in nature, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 2009
	<br><br>
	“Firstly, don’t call your matrix ‘matrix’. Would you call your dog ‘dog’? Anyway, it might clash with the function ‘matrix’.”
	<br>Barry Rowlingson, R-help, 2004

	“I thank the National Science Foundation for regularly rejecting my (honest) grant applications for work on real organisms (cf. Szent-Gyorgyi, 1972), thus forcing me into theoretical work.”
	<br>Leigh Van Valen, A new evolutionary law, Evolutionary Theory, 1973

	"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled."
	<br>Richard Feynman, Rogers Commission Report, 1986

	"I will just comment on infinity here, and just for a moment"
	<br>Guy Hoelzer, an undergraduate lecture on evolution, 09 Feb 2012

	“Podan el arbol de la Vida para que florezca y no muera.”
	(They trim the tree of life so that it is renewed and does not die.)
	<br>Diego Rivera, Las Manos del Dr. Moore (The Hands of Dr. Moore), 1940

	“Good science can wait.”
	<br>Joan Strassmann, blog, 21 May 2013

	“Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.”
	<br>George Box, Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces,1987

	“But as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous position— namely, at the close of the Introduction—the following words: ‘I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification.’ This has been of no avail. Great is the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure.”
	<br>Charles Darwin, The origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life, 1872 (6th edition)

	“With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.”
