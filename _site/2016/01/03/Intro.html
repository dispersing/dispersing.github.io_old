<p>Hello world.</p>

<p>I have decided after many years of deliberation that 2016 will be the year that I begin writing on my professional work and sharing it over the internet.  My inspiration really began growing last autumn when we published a software package that I wanted to host on a contributed-blogging site.  I had no previous blogs to post at that time to demonstrate my abilities as a blogger and competence for the site, which is required for the site.  In addition to wanting to publish on that site, I recently read a quote: `blog like nobody's reading.'  I often find myself worrying too much about what others think, and I am using that quote to necessarily continually remind myself that I want to do this and it doesn't need to be perfect.</p>

<p>The material that I will post will be related to the work I do, which is the science of ecology.  <b>As ecologists we try to understand why organisms are found where they are, plain an simple.</b>  As one could imagine, there are so many different ways of tacking this problem: sometimes behaviour is important, sometime history is important, sometimes climate is important, and sometimes other organisms are important, as examples.</p>

<p>In my approach to this field of science, I focus on how organisms disperse and how they interact with other organisms.  My first step into ecology looked at plants whose seeds are dispersed by animals.  I used field studies to experimentally track seeds and fruits, and I looked at the large-scale implications of various types of animal dispersal by studying distributions of animal-dispersed plants across North America.  After I fished this work for my doctoral degree, my next step as an independent researcher was into a position to use mathematics to understand the mutually beneficial relationship between species, like seed-dispersing animals and plants.  (In the latter relationship, the animals benefit by gaining nutritious rewards from plant seeds and fruits, and plants benefit by being dispersed to high-quality sites to grow.)</p>

<p>I predict that most of the material will be reflections on news, literature, and sociology of ecology.  I will also be using this to post <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, to hopefully interest readers of that site in ecology and I can use readers' feedback on programming.</p>

<p>Lastly, this entire website was generated using the blog-aware, static-site generator, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.  I switched from proprietary software (specifically, iWeb) to be transparent so others--if they choose--can learn from this site (code is also available at <a href="https://github.com/dispersing/dispersing.github.io">GitHub</a>).  Oh, it's also pretty simple to use and is aesthetically pleasing to me.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Goodbye world.</p>
