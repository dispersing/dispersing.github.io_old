<p> Posters a lot of work. </p>

I am currently preparing for a meeting for The American Society of Naturalists (ASN).  ASN normally meets jointly with several other closely-related groups (e.g., Society for the Study of Evolution, Society of Systematic Biologists), but occasionally has their own, stand-alone meeting.</p>

<p>The meeting will be smaller, which is nice.  Registration purportedly capped at 250 participants, and I have see that there are 215 people Cc-ed on the emails form the organizers.  This is really a good size for professional meetings, as more people with interact with more in the group than larger meetings (think 5,000 at the Ecology meeting), and the intellectual stimulation in a group of fewer people is less exciting.</p>

<p>At this meeting, I will be presenting my postdoc work with Karen to a scientific audience for the first time.  I am very excited about finally being able to have some work to share and discuss.  The format by which I am presenting is poster.  I generally prefer to give talks at meetings of this size because they are <b>much less work!</b>  Fifteen-to-twenty slides over 15 minutes gives one much more flexibility for presentation methodology (e.g., animations) and the timeframe to explain what one did.  For a poster, however, one must distill the reasoning underlying a study, how the study was conducted, what was found, and what was learned.  Forget about the 15-to-20 minutes, in a poster, one has about <b><i>ONE SQUARE METER</i></b> to cover all of same material (usually with less time!).  So, the goal of a poster is to get the talking points home and wow people with some graphs in a visually digestable piece--above is my attempt at this.</p>

<p>Above I have embedded my <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a> image of my poster.  Visually, I think that it has a lot of what will help me communicate my message:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
	<li>the sections are clearly delimited, with the pith in a brighter shade of red</li>
	<li>each section box has a clear heading</li>
	<li>subsections have clear formatting</li>
	<li>graphs and font sizes are large enough to read</li>
	<li>there is not too much text</li>
</ul>
<p>the last point is especially important to me, with posters.  From my experience, it seems that very few people read posters in-depth, and that the poster format is really just a guide for verbal engagement.</p>

<p>I have two major criticisms of this work.  First, in the <u>findings</u> section, there are <i>way too many graphs</i>.  Each graph is not supposed to be interpreted alone, but rather collectively as for each of the three main panels.  Nevertheless, I think that I could have better summarized the findings of each of the three main panels.  I would have if I had a bit more time to analyze them, leading me to my second criticism: the work is not fully complete.  For many of the models, I have graphically, and analytically or numerically analyzed the model.  A few days before I was to print it, I realized that for one of the three main panels, I had analyzed it wrong--yikes!  So, I did the best with what I have.  I am sure it will be fine for this meeting.</p>

<p>I don't know how many hours I put into this poster, and I don't really want to know!  Because I can sometimes really be overly precise and scrutinize relatively trivial aspects of my work (e.g., I was literally measuring every little detail on the poster and entering component coordinates and sizes, like boxes, manually), it took a lot of time.  I had no urgency when I started it a few weeks ago, but when I was still working on it within the hour before I could no longer sent it to print, you'd better believe that I completely forgot about those details!</p>

<p>I am eager about the meeting and I feel pretty excited to talk with others about my work.</p>

<!--
<p>I have decided after many years of deliberation that 2016 will be the year that I begin writing on my professional work and sharing it over the internet.  My inspiration really began growing last autumn when we published a software package that I wanted to host on a contributed-blogging site.  I had no previous blogs to post at that time to demonstrate my abilities as a blogger and competence for the site, which is required for the site.  In addition to wanting to publish on that site, I recently read a quote: `blog like nobody's reading.'  I often find myself worrying too much about what others think, and I am using that quote to necessarily continually remind myself that I want to do this and it doesn't need to be perfect.</p>

<p>The material that I will post will be related to the work I do, which is the science of ecology.  <b>As ecologists we try to understand why organisms are found where they are, plain an simple.</b>  As one could imagine, there are so many different ways of tacking this problem: sometimes behaviour is important, sometime history is important, sometimes climate is important, and sometimes other organisms are important, as examples.</p>

<p>In my approach to this field of science, I focus on how organisms disperse and how they interact with other organisms.  My first step into ecology looked at plants whose seeds are dispersed by animals.  I used field studies to experimentally track seeds and fruits, and I looked at the large-scale implications of various types of animal dispersal by studying distributions of animal-dispersed plants across North America.  After I fished this work for my doctoral degree, my next step as an independent researcher was into a position to use mathematics to understand the mutually beneficial relationship between species, like seed-dispersing animals and plants.  (In the latter relationship, the animals benefit by gaining nutritious rewards from plant seeds and fruits, and plants benefit by being dispersed to high-quality sites to grow.)</p>

<p>I predict that most of the material will be reflections on news, literature, and sociology of ecology.  I will also be using this to post <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, to hopefully interest readers of that site in ecology and I can use readers' feedback on programming.</p>

<p>Lastly, this entire website was generated using the blog-aware, static-site generator, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.  I switched from proprietary software (specifically, iWeb) to be transparent so others--if they choose--can learn from this site (code is also available at <a href="https://github.com/dispersing/dispersing.github.io">GitHub</a>).  Oh, it's also pretty simple to use and is aesthetically pleasing to me.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Goodbye world.</p>
