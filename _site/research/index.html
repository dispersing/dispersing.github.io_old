	<td valign="top" rowspan="1"><h4>Mutualism and species interactions</h4>
	<p align="justify">Mutualism describes the phenomenon where two populations gain a fitness benefit as direct result each other's presence.  As a simple thought experiment, consider iterating the effect of mutual benefit between two populations: they would feed off each other's growth and grow uncontrollably.  And obviously, we don't see infinitely-large populations in nature.  My main question in studying this common type of population interaction is therefore: <b>how are populations of mutualist populations bounded?</b>
	<br>
	I am currently addressing this question through development of mathematical models in the lab of <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/CWRU/Home.html">Karen Abbott</a> at Case Western Reserve University as a postdoctoral research associate.  In our work, we have found a way to re-envision different types (e.g., service, food, defense) of mutualistic interactions, developed a theory within this new framework, and generated a set of critical experiments that will allow me to test our predictions and assumptions in the future.

	<td valign="top"><h4>Dispersal and spatial ecology</h4>
	<p align="justify">
	Dispersal describes the spatial or temporal displacement of organisms.  All life as we know it disperses: some organisms actively seek new habitats, some organisms are passively dispersed to new habitats, and some organisms remain inactive or suspended until conditions are right, which is dispersal through time.  A major part of my research interests is understanding <b>how dispersal effects ecological and evolutionary dynamics</b>.  For my dissertation, I described a mechanism for dispersal for a species of plant that was previously unknown (<a href="../publications#manzdisp">Moore and Vander Wall, <i>Plant Eco.</i>, 2015</a>).  This made me become more interested in the relationship between disperser behaviour and patterns of seed deposition.  The curves to the right, for example, are the same distribution, but displayed as the probability of dispersal to a point (left) and probability of dispersal to a given distance (i.e., annulus; right).
	<br>
	I also co-developed the North American Seed Dispersal Project, where we quantified range and distributional characteristics of plant species across the continent by different vectors of dispersal (Vander Wall and Moore, <i>Global Eco. and Biogeog.</i>, in revision) and how that relates to the animals that disperse them (Dittel, Moore, and Vander Wall, in prep.).
	<br>
	I have also pursued several modeling projects to look at population dynamics and disease in a spatial-modeling context.
