		It has been difficult to incorporate mutualism into ecological and evolutionary theory.  Charles Darwin struggled to explain the evolution of plant-pollinator mutualists; early twentieth-century population ecologists confounded mutualism with symbiosis and parasitism; and most modern openly leaves out mutualism.  Mutualism has perhaps taken a back seat because it is physically less conspicuous and it is conceptually and analytically less tractable.  The latter intractabilities are rooted in the fundamental nature of mutualism in the Lotka-Volterra analytical framework, where, unlike predator-prey or competitive formulations, models of mutualism positively feedback back on each other.  The consequence of the positive feedback leads to seemingly unrealistic models where populations grow exponentially without bounds in, to use Robert May's words,``...an orgy of mutual benefaction.''  Infinite populations are obviously impossible and unobserved, but because the foundation modern theory in the 1970s and 1980s ignored mutualism because of its positive-feedback `problem,' theoretical development was set back, but mostly forgotten.  I have therefore become burdened to investigate some of the basic theoretical aspects of mutualism, and simultaneously develop an empirical program to test the assumptions and outcomes of this theoretical development.

		<td valign="top"><h4>Dispersal</h4>
Dispersal is an emergent property of biological systems existing in a spatial world. Specifically, if rules governing autonomous biological agents are to (i) acquire and utilize resources to respectively (ii) metabolize and reproduce, then space is a limiting factor in areas with finite resources. Further, if parents have a greater ability to acquire resources than filial generations, only offspring of the ultimate reproduction event would have a survival probability greater than zero. Therefore, we observe movement away from parents (dispersal) as a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in all biological systems that increases the ability of biological agents to acquire resources and reproduce.
